## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
There are N employees in Ural University, numbered from 1 to N.

Their organizational structure is a tree: every employee except the root has a direct supervisor (a parent node in the tree).

Each employee has a happiness value Hi, where 1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N.

A committee meeting is being planned. However:

No direct supervisor and subordinate can attend the meeting together.

The goal is:

Select a subset of employees to attend the meeting such that no two directly related employees are both selected, and the sum of happiness values of the selected attendees is maximized.

# idea
the problem is simple and straight forward, first we can know if a node we dont want, then we can take all the value of its chilren. so we use dp, to mark if we want or we dont want, that can help us to avoid invaild choice

# transition function

```
dp[i][0] = sum(max(dp[v][1], dp[v][0]))
dp[i][1] = sum(dp[v][0])
```


# solution

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 6005;

vector<int> tree[MAXN];
int happiness[MAXN];
int dp[MAXN][2];
bool has_parent[MAXN];  // to find the root

void dfs(int u) {
    dp[u][1] = happiness[u];  // if we take u

    for (int v : tree[u]) {
        dfs(v);
        dp[u][0] += max(dp[v][0], dp[v][1]); // if we don't take u
        dp[u][1] += dp[v][0];                // if we take u, we can't take v
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    // read happiness
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cin >> happiness[i];
    }

    // read tree edges
    int u, v;
    while (cin >> u >> v && (u != 0 || v != 0)) {
        tree[v].push_back(u);  // u is child of v
        has_parent[u] = true;
    }

    // find root (node with no parent)
    int root = 1;
    while (has_parent[root]) root++;

    dfs(root);

    cout << max(dp[root][0], dp[root][1]) << endl;

    return 0;
}

```
